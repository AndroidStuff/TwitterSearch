# TwitterSearch

## My Way
    - Look for sample projects in Github, download and execute it.
    - Now go do the shit yourself.
    - Side-effect: If things are very challenging or interesting, you'll end up buying the material based on which the project is inspired from.
    - Side Note: I find Safari Online Subscription a worth-while investment into learning. Seriously, go get it and reap the benefits!
